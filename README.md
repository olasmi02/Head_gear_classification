## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of headgear belonging to 20 different classes. The dataset is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set contains 3620 images, the validation set contains 100 images, and the testing set contains 100 images.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following libraries and frameworks:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started
To clone this repository, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olasmi02/Head_gear_classification.git
```

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required libraries and frameworks as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
3. Download the headgear dataset and place it in the appropriate directories: `train/`, `valid/`, and `test/`.
4. Open the notebook file `headgear_classification.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and testing.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the validation set and a test accuracy of 94% on the testing set.
